## Assumed Threat Model

- BaseComp: Attacker intercepts, drops, injects and modifies messages between the base station and the victim
    - Cryptographic keys are assumed to be secure: Attacker cannot counterfeit messages with a correct MAC
- FirmWire: Rouge base station
    - Claimed to be "most realistic"
    - No prior authentication performed - attacks should be possible on arbitrary phones

- NOTE: Extend attacker model to a mobile network operator (MNO) who exploits his position?
    - Advantage: extends the attacker surface
